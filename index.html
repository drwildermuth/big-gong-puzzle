  <h1>üéâ Welcome to The Big Gong Puzzle üéâ</h1>
  <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Click the buttons below to draw your Character Card and Information Cards. Each student should draw <strong>1 character</strong> and <strong>2 information cards</strong>. <em>Not all cards are unique</em> ‚Äî some may be drawn more than once. Your team may need to draw extra cards and share findings to uncover the full picture. If you have fewer than 8 students, some players should volunteer to draw additional cards!</p>
