  <h1>🎉 Welcome to The Big Gong Puzzle 🎉</h1>
  <div class="card-box">
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br>
    Your team must open the Big Gong box by working together. Each of you should draw at least <strong>1 character card</strong> and <strong>2 information cards</strong>. If fewer than 8 people are present, volunteers may draw extra cards. All instructions are hidden within the cards. Share information, listen carefully, and be ready to puzzle through confusion.</p>
